Find a link to my deployed app here:

I completed a password generator which takes you through prompts of the main guidelines/criteria for this password to be secure. 

If you don't meet the criteria along the way when following the prompts it succesfully takes you to a prompt specifying you don't meet the criteria, so to start again. 

The criteria is: 
- Password needs to be between 8-128 characters
- Needs lowercase
- Needs uppercase
- Needs a number 
- Needs a special character 

Once they press okay via the prompts, the password generator succesfully generates and displays a secure password.
